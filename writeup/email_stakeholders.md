Hi all,

I wanted to bring to your attention some data quality issues that were discovered while performing exploratory data analysis on the data in json format. You can find more details [here](eda.ipynb). In summary, there are multiple missing values and a few inconsistent values. Additionally, the details about the brands are missing altogether.

To resolve these issues, I would need more information about the cause of the problems and access to any relevant documentation. I am also planning to implement strategies such as data compression and partitioning to optimize the data for production use and address any potential performance concerns. In addition, I will be implementing appropriate security measures to mitigate the risk of data breaches or vulnerabilities.

Please let me know if you have any questions or additional information that could be helpful.

Thanks,
Archana
